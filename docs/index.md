**Welcome to the first regional Enterprise and Government Strategy from Cardano in Oceania**

Here in Oceania — Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, and the (25,000) Pacific Islands — we’re not just building blockchain experiments; we’re proving what’s possible when digital infrastructure meets real-world needs.

We are already collaborating with governments across the region  redeveloping systems for social investment, health care and supply chains. We are working alongside Indigenous communities shaping sovereign governance models and market infrastructure to create new RWA value. This is not theory. This is work on the ground.

But here’s the invitation: **we can’t do this without you.**

As a DRep, your voice, your delegation, and your leadership are the difference between pilots that stay local and innovations that can be promoted and acquire the resources to scale globally. You’re the bridge between technical possibility, constitutional accountability and foundational funding flows and mission-driven outcomes.

Why does this matter to Cardano?

Because Oceania is:

- A live testbed where blockchain helps farmers trace crops, governments rethink welfare, and indigenous people assert economic independance.
 
- A geopolitical hinge — connecting East and West, Global North and South

- A region that knows the stakes of climate, inclusion, and sovereignty — and is hungry for technologies that serve **people and create markets**.

**Importantly, everything here has been bootstrapped. Including our engagement in governance.**

To date, the teams in Oceania have focused every ounce of funding and energy – including our Project Catalyst projects, into delivery — not promotion. We’ve prioritised outcomes over optics, building credibility through doing, while the rest of the world sleeps. That’s why you may not have seen glossy reports or splashy marketing yet — but the groundwork is solid, the results are real, and now is the time to tell that story.

**This is your chance to help us shape a model for Regional and Vertical investment into Cardano as public goods infrastructure, specifically in enterprise and government, and model ready to ripple worldwide.**

We invite you to:

- Explore the projects already in motion
- Connect with the builders, project leaders, and Indigenous innovators here
- Bring your governance expertise to a region ready to amplify impact

We’re calling on DReps who understand that governance is not just about casting votes — it’s about **investing time, attention, and resources where the returns lift communities and ecosystems alike.** Let’s show the world what DReps can do — not just inside the protocol, but in partnership with the people who trust Cardano to deliver.

**Cheers,** Vinaka, Fakaaue, Oue tulou, Meitaki, Ko rab'a, Faka'amu, Kia ora.
