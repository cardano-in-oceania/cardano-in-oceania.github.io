The Cardano in Oceania 2025–2026 strategy and budget presented here is a comprehensive plan designed to ignite Cardano’s growth in a strategically important region. By investing in people (capacity building and community), projects (hackathons and pilots), and promotion (marketing and storytelling), we create a virtuous cycle: more talent and awareness leads to more projects, which lead to real adoption and success stories, which in turn attract even more talent and partnerships. This aligns closely with Cardano’s mission of building a world-changing ecosystem – starting locally in Oceania, with ripples globally.

For Treasury and funding stakeholders, the plan offers a clear narrative of value creation:

- It addresses an immediate opportunity (high crypto adoption and interest in Oceania) with a targeted approach.

- It builds long-term capability by training local leaders and developers, reducing reliance on external teams in the future.

- It emphasizes measurable outcomes (with specific KPIs and milestones) and accountability (regular reporting and adaptive management).

- It also ensures the Cardano community is at the centre, fostering organic growth that can sustain itself post-2026.

By the end of 2026, we expect Oceania to be a thriving node in Cardano’s global network – with active communities in multiple countries, startups and enterprises deploying Cardano solutions, and a pipeline of innovations flowing from the region. The insights and model from this program can then be exported to other regions, fulfilling the broader goal of scaling Cardano adoption worldwide.

We respectfully submit this strategy for funding consideration, confident that it represents a high-impact investment. With the requested resources, the Cardano in Oceania initiative will demonstrate how a focused regional strategy can deliver outsized results – cultivating an ecosystem that is greater than the sum of its parts, and contributing meaningfully to Cardano’s global success.

## Executive Summary

The work programme we've outlined on this site has been designed to support the members of our community to build on the volunteer contributions they've made over the last 5+ years. It launches a professional collaboration that will market Cardano in Oceania as part of a multi-year strategy. The programme covers the first, launch year, through which we will demonstrate our capability, hit clear milestones, and establish a trusted foundation for Cardano’s growth in our region. Future phases will scale on the strength of what we prove in this first year.

The grid below shows how the various actions and artefacts relate to the marketing funnel at each level of engagement. The rest of this site provides timelines, stage gates and detailed information about the programme of work for which we seek treasury funding.
