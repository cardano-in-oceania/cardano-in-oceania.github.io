# Experience: Who are we?

## Community Leaders
Whether executing a community initiative like ours or a private business project, strong leadership is important for ensuring the proposed program of work is effectively coordinated and that there is accountability for delivering against the objectives. Our community leaders have a long-standing reputation in the Cardano ecosystem, both locally and globally, with experience necessary to help achieve our strategic goals.

### Peter Bui
Peter Bui is a developer and educator who bridges mainstream web technologies with Cardano.

Within Cardano he runs the eco-friendly ADAOZ stake pool, is a meetup organiser and serves as a long-standing Cardano Ambassador, sharing clear, beginner-friendly insights through his popular Learn Cardano podcast and YouTube channel, which have clocked more than two million views.

In 2025 he expanded his impact by standing as a DRep, promising transparent voting on treasury and governance proposals and reinforcing his commitment to responsible, community-driven network growth.

## Sponsors & Partners
While we have an enthusiastic group of individuals who are passionate to see Cardano grow in Oceania, we acknowledge that passion alone isn't enough to achieve our objectives, and that many organisations also have a vested interest in seeing Cardano thrive.  We are therefore appreciative of the support that organisations in our region have already given to our ecosystem and who are committed to continue supporting us through this project.  They bring co-funding (through sponsorship), infrastructure & tools, as well as case studies or lessons learned from Cardano based projects.  This helps provide efficiency to everyone’s contributions, better utilisation of funds and more effective outcomes that are aimed at delivering real world solutions.
