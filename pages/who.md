# Experience: Who are we?

<div class="section" markdown="1">

## Community Leaders
Whether executing a community initiative like ours or a private business project, strong leadership is important for ensuring that the proposed program of work is effectively coordinated and that there is accountability for delivering against the objectives. Our community leaders have a long-standing reputation in the Cardano ecosystem, both locally and globally, with experience necessary to help achieve our strategic goals.

Our first exercise is to convene partners already listed on this site, map their interests, networks, Cardano adoption goals, contributions and identify value pairs. This ensures every collaboration adds measurable value to the ecosystem.

This Year 1 is a pilot year where we test collaborations, establish value-pairs between partners, and demonstrate to the wider Cardano community that Oceania can deliver results worth scaling and replicating.

## Sponsors & Partners
While we have an enthusiastic group of individuals who are passionate to see Cardano grow in Oceania, we acknowledge that passion alone isn't enough to achieve our objectives, and that many organisations also have a vested interest in seeing Cardano thrive.  We are therefore appreciative of the support that organisations in our region have already given to our ecosystem and who are committed to continue supporting us through this project.  They bring co-funding (through sponsorship), infrastructure & tools, as well as case studies or lessons learned from Cardano based projects.  This helps provide efficiency to everyone’s contributions, better utilisation of funds and more effective outcomes that are aimed at delivering real world solutions.

### 46 South Stake Pool (46S)
As the world’s southern most Cardano stake pool, for over 3 years 46 South has been running on bare-metal servers powered entirely by 100% renewable energy, in the far south of New Zealand. But they are more than just infrastructure. A portion of the stake pool's rewards are donated to Pest Free Token, a New Zealand charity dedicated to eradicating introduced pests that threaten native bird species. Delegators to 46S, are not only supporting the Cardano network — they’re investing in a healthier Aotearoa, safeguarding its unique ecosystems, and helping keep birds safe from those annoying predators! The team believe that blockchain technology has the power to create real-world impact — and by aligning technology with local conservation efforts, they aim to bring those possibilities to life in tangible ways.
