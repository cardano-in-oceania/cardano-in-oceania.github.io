## Budget Overview 2025–2026
The following table summarizes the proposed budget for the Cardano in Oceania initiative, broken down by key components.

| Budget Item | 2025–26 Total (ada) | Notes |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| Business Development Program | 120,000 | Contract an Oceania BD team, run BD bootcamps, partner outreach travel. |
| Australian Crypto Convention | 120,000 | Sponsorship package, booth branding and furnishing, promotional material. Cardano side event. |
| Ecosystem Mapping & Activation | 50,000 | Tools, coordinator stipend, surveys for community mapping. |
| Hackathon | 120,000 | Major Oceania Hackathon – venue, logistics, prizes, marketing, mentorship support, some travel grants for participants (based on Berlin hackathon \~₳100k benchmark) |
| Community Events & Workshops | 75,000 | \~20 local in-person events across the region, plus governance/education workshops. |
| Monthly Town Halls (Virtual) | 5,000 | 24 online sessions over 2 years (covering any platform fees, host stipends). |
| Marketing & Communications | 60,000 | Community content fund, paid ads, media sponsorships, video production, and PR agency support. |
| Contingency | 15,000 | Reserve for unplanned costs. |
| Administration & Audits | 18,000 | Fund management and reporting. |
| **Grand Total (2025–2026)** | **583,000** |

This budget reflects a significant investment designed to achieve a step-change in Cardano’s presence in Oceania. We expect to leverage this funding efficiently by also seeking in-kind support and partnerships – for instance, event co-sponsorships could reduce our net costs, and content created by the community often exceeds the value of the modest grants provided.

The spending will be phased over the 12 months, with some front-loading in 2025 (for initial program setup and the hackathon) and the remainder in 2026 (for follow-up events and second-year activities). We will implement strong financial oversight and transparency in managing this budget, with quarterly reports to the Cardano Community broadly, as well as to the Treasury (and any local funders), on expenditures versus the plan. Notably, the hackathon and other initiatives will practice transparent budget management, similar to Catalyst projects. Any unused contingency or cost savings will be reported and potentially returned to the treasury or reallocated with approval.

## Implementation Timeline and Milestones
We outline below the timeline of major milestones across 2025 and 2026\. This plan will be executed in phases, allowing for iteration and learning:

* **Q3 2025:** Initiation – Recruit the Oceania BD Lead and onboard the core project team. Kick off the ecosystem mapping effort (send surveys, start data gathering). Announce the Cardano Oceania strategy publicly to galvanize community support. Set up online channels (dedicated Telegram/Discord, etc.) for the region. Milestone: Team in place and mapping in progress by end of Q1.

* **Q4 2025:** Acceleration – Launch the BD Capacity Program with the first training bootcamp for BD Fellows. Begin outreach to target partners (initial meetings with companies/universities). Finalize hackathon planning: secure venue, open registrations, begin marketing push. Conduct a couple of pre-hackathon workshops (intro to Cardano tech) in Sydney and Auckland to prime participants. Hold regular meetups in at least 2 cities this quarter and monthly virtual town halls. Milestone: Hackathon fully planned and \>50% of participant slots pre-registered by end of Q2; 5+ BD Fellows trained in bootcamp 1\.

* **Q1 2026:** Execution – Oceania Cardano Hackathon 2025 takes place. Deliverable: successful 2-3 day hackathon event with 100+ attendees and projects built. Immediately after, provide continuity to hackathon teams (post-event mentorship, connect winners to funding opportunities). Attend the Australian Crypto Convention 2025 (usually around Q3/Q4) with a Cardano booth – use it to showcase hackathon winners and recruit more interest. Continue monthly meetups (including a special “post-hackathon roadshow” meetup in several cities to demo the hackathon projects to local audiences). Milestone: Hackathon delivered by Q3; Cardano presence at ACC with significant booth engagement (collect \>200 leads/contacts).

* **Q2 2026:** Expansion & Reflection – Complete the first iteration of the Oceania Ecosystem Map and publish a report of findings (who’s who in the community, gaps identified). Hold a strategy review meeting with stakeholders (Cardano Foundation, community reps) to assess year 1 progress and adjust 2026 plans as needed. Marketing focus this quarter on storytelling: publish a video case study from the hackathon or a success story of a Cardano partnership formed. Run governance workshops especially if Catalyst or on-chain governance events (e.g. constitutional votes) are upcoming – prepare the community to participate. Milestone: Oceania Ecosystem Map v1.0 released in Q4; at least 2 partnership MOUs in discussion or signed by end of 2025 as a result of BD efforts. Onboard any new team members or fellows (if expanding the BD program). Set specific 2026 targets (perhaps focusing on converting year-1 leads into deployed projects). Possibly initiate plans for a 2026 hackathon or developer workshop series (depending on success of 2025, we may opt for a second hackathon in another location or a smaller “buildathon” event). Continue regular community events (meetups/town halls). Milestone: Confirm whether a 2026 Hackathon or Cardano Summit side-event in Oceania will occur (decision by Q1 so planning can start if yes).

* **Q3 2026:** Building Momentum – Focus on project incubation: some of the 2025 hackathon projects or partnerships should be entering implementation stages now. Ensure they have support (technical guidance, possibly funding). Promote these early outcomes via marketing (e.g. a blog series “Projects to Watch in Oceania”). Host a mid-point community town hall in Q2 2026 to report on all KPIs publicly – transparency to the community and Treasury about progress. Milestone: At least one Cardano-based solution piloted in a real-world setting in Oceania by mid-2026 (e.g. a supply chain pilot going live, or a local government trial using Cardano). Culmination Events – If scheduled, execute the 2026 Cardano Oceania Hackathon or Summit event in this period (or join the global Cardano Summit with a strong Oceania delegation). Use this as a capstone to showcase two years of work: have BD Fellows, partners, and community members present their accomplishments. Possibly unveil new partnerships or products. Gather feedback and outcomes as input for final reporting. Milestone: Successful execution of final event; broad media coverage achieved for Cardano’s presence in Oceania by Q3.

* **Q4 2026:** Conclusion & Next Steps – Wrap up the strategy with a comprehensive report to the Treasury/funders and community. This report will detail outcomes against KPIs (e.g. how many developers trained, projects launched, users onboarded, etc.), lessons learned, and a proposal for either transitioning to a self-sustaining community model or a request for continued funding (if the results warrant scaling up further). Conduct a final round of community consultations – perhaps a survey or open forum – to get input on how the community feels about Cardano’s growth in Oceania and what they need going forward. Milestone: All deliverables completed by end of 2026, final report delivered, and a clear plan (and possibly governance handover to local leadership or a DAO) for post-2026 continuity.

Throughout the timeline, monitoring and evaluation will be continuous. Each quarter will have defined targets (number of events held, people reached, etc.), and we will use these to course-correct. The timeline also retains flexibility – for instance, if an opportunity arises to collaborate on a national-level project in 2026, we might reallocate some event budget to support that, as long as it aligns with our objectives.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Value Creation
To gauge the success and impact of the Cardano Oceania 2025–26 strategy, we have identified clear KPIs across all program dimensions:

* **Ecosystem Growth:** Community size and activity – Double the number of active Cardano community members in Oceania (measured via meetup attendance, local Telegram/Discord group sizes, etc.). Grow the number of Cardano wallets or on-chain usage in Oceania by 50% over two years (as a proxy, track growth in transactions originating from Oceania IPs or participation in Cardano-based dApps from the region).

* **Developer Engagement:** Hackathon and dev events – Train or engage 200+ developers through hackathons, workshops, and meetups. KPI: at least 100 new developers (who were not previously building on Cardano) actively participate in our hackathon or coding events (signified by code submissions). Aim for 20+ hackathon projects, with at least 3 projects continuing development post-event (entering Catalyst, GitHub repos active 3 months later, etc.).

* **Partnerships & Use Cases:** Business development outcomes – Sign 3 or more partnership agreements or MOUs with organizations (enterprises, startups, or government agencies) to build on Cardano or trial Cardano solutions. By 2026, target at least 1 live pilot project in each of these categories: government/public sector, enterprise, and social impact/non-profit. For example, a government department using Cardano for a pilot, a private company adopting a Cardano-based supply chain or identity solution, and an NGO leveraging Cardano for a community project. These real use cases will be the ultimate proof of value creation.

* **Talent and Capacity:** BD and leadership capacity – Through the capacity-building program, produce 5–10 trained Cardano “business champions” in Oceania (people who can continue evangelizing and onboarding others beyond 2026). KPI: number of graduates from the BD program who take on leadership roles (e.g. start a Cardano startup, join Cardano Foundation, or lead a local Cardano chapter). Also, have all key team members certified (Cardano Foundation Academy or equivalent) to ensure deep expertise.

* **Content & Outreach Metrics:** Marketing impact – Deliver at least 48 pieces of original content (blog posts, videos, podcasts) over 2 years via community and official channels. Achieve a cumulative reach of \>500,000 impressions on social media and online campaigns promoting Cardano in Oceania . Grow engagement: for instance, raise the average Oceania town hall attendance to \>50 live viewers (from perhaps 20–30 initially) and achieve \>5,000 views on each major video story produced. Media mentions: Secure coverage in at least 5 mainstream or industry media outlets about Cardano activities in Oceania (e.g. an article in an Aussie tech magazine or a segment on NZ tech news).

* **Governance Participation:** Cardano community governance – Increase the involvement of Oceania’s community in Cardano governance processes. KPI: by 2026, have Oceania representation in Catalyst and governance roles such as 2–3 new funded Catalyst proposals coming from Oceania teams, an increase in registered voters from Oceania (target \+30%), and at least one Oceania community member attaining a recognized role (e.g. Catalyst Community Advisor, DRep (delegated representative) or even a Cardano Improvement Proposal co-author).

* **Treasury Return on Investment:** Long-term value creation – While harder to quantify in the short term, we will track indicators of sustainable ecosystem growth that justify the treasury investment. For example, number of new Cardano startups formed (target 3+ by 2026), follow-on funding attracted by Oceania projects (e.g. a project getting external VC or government grants after initial incubation, target: at least $1M in aggregate follow-on funding), and improvements in Cardano’s global metrics attributable to Oceania (such as network effect – more developers and users – contributing to Cardano’s adoption which can reflect in ADA utility/demand). We will present these outcomes in narrative form to illustrate how this program creates value well beyond its cost, seeding economic activity and social good that far exceeds the initial funding.
