## Budget Overview
The following table summarises the proposed budget for the Cardano in Oceania initiative, broken down by key components.

| Budget Item | Total (ada) | Notes |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| Business Development Program | 120,000 | Contract an Oceania BD team, run BD bootcamps, partner outreach travel. |
| Australian Crypto Convention | 120,000 | Sponsorship package, booth branding and furnishing, promotional material. Cardano side event. |
| Ecosystem Mapping & Activation | 50,000 | Tools, coordinator stipend, surveys for community mapping. |
| Hackathon | 120,000 | Major Oceania Hackathon – venue, logistics, prizes, marketing, mentorship support, some travel grants for participants (based on Berlin hackathon \~₳100k benchmark) |
| Community Events & Workshops | 75,000 | \~20 local in-person events across the region, plus governance/education workshops. |
| Monthly Town Halls (Virtual) | 5,000 | 24 online sessions over 2 years (covering any platform fees, host stipends). |
| Marketing & Communications | 60,000 | Community content fund, paid ads, media sponsorships, video production, and PR agency support. |
| Contingency | 15,000 | Reserve for unplanned costs. |
| Administration & Audits | 18,000 | Fund management and reporting. |
| **Grand Total (2025–2026)** | **583,000** |

This budget reflects a significant investment designed to achieve a step-change in Cardano’s presence in Oceania. We expect to leverage this funding efficiently by also seeking in-kind support and partnerships – for instance, event co-sponsorships could reduce our net costs, and content created by the community often exceeds the value of the modest grants provided.

The spending will be phased over the 12 months, with some front-loading in 2025 for program setup and launch. We will implement strong financial oversight and transparency in managing this budget, with quarterly reports to the Cardano Community broadly, as well as to the Treasury (and any local funders), on expenditures versus the plan. Notably, the hackathon and other initiatives will practice transparent budget management, similar to Catalyst projects. Any unused contingency or cost savings will be reported and potentially returned to the treasury or reallocated with approval.

**Milestone:**  
✅ Hackathon delivered; ecosystem map published; 3+ projects progressing beyond the event; mentorship pathways engaged.

### **Q3 2026 – Incubation, Reflection & Decision Point**
- **Project Incubation:** Provide ongoing support to top hackathon projects or BD collaborations entering pilot stage (e.g. government, NGO, or enterprise trials).
- **Community Events:** Continue monthly town halls and hold Roundtable #2 to track ecosystem outcomes and gaps.
- **Governance Workshops:** Run in-person or online workshops aligned with any live governance activity (e.g. Catalyst voting or constitutional votes).
- **Strategy Review:** Conduct formal stakeholder review to assess KPIs and make go/no-go decision on a **Capstone Event** or **Summit side event**.
- **Marketing Push:** Publish blog series or mini-documentary: "Projects to Watch in Oceania."

**Milestone:**  
✅ At least one Cardano-based solution in pilot; Capstone decision finalized; early success stories promoted.

### **Q4 2026 – Capstone Event & Final Reporting**
- **Capstone Event (optional):** If approved, execute the **Cardano Oceania Capstone Showcase** or regional **Summit side-event**. Present hackathon outcomes, BD wins, governance progress, and community growth.
- **Final Community Feedback:** Run a region-wide consultation (survey/forum) on next-phase priorities, needs, and vision.
- **Final Report:** Deliver comprehensive impact report to the Treasury and community: KPIs, financials, partnership status, and stories of change.
- **Transition Planning:** Propose and begin executing continuity options: e.g. transitioning to a **DAO**, integrating with Intersect governance, or preparing a follow-on funding proposal.

**Milestone:**  
✅ Final report delivered; all program KPIs assessed; continuity strategy supported by community.

Throughout the timeline, monitoring and evaluation will be continuous. Each quarter will have defined targets (number of events held, people reached, etc.), and we will use these to course-correct. The timeline also retains flexibility – for instance, if an opportunity arises to collaborate on a national-level project in 2026, we might reallocate some event budget to support that, as long as it aligns with our objectives.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Value Creation
To gauge the success and impact of the Cardano Oceania 2025–26 strategy, we have identified clear KPIs across all program dimensions:

* **Ecosystem Growth:** Community size and activity – Double the number of active Cardano community members in Oceania (measured via meetup attendance, local Telegram/Discord group sizes, etc.). Grow the number of Cardano wallets or on-chain usage in Oceania by 50% over two years (as a proxy, track growth in transactions originating from Oceania IPs or participation in Cardano-based dApps from the region).

* **Developer Engagement:** Hackathon and dev events – Train or engage 200+ developers through hackathons, workshops, and meetups. KPI: at least 100 new developers (who were not previously building on Cardano) actively participate in our hackathon or coding events (signified by code submissions). Aim for 20+ hackathon projects, with at least 3 projects continuing development post-event (entering Catalyst, GitHub repos active 3 months later, etc.).

* **Partnerships & Use Cases:** Business development outcomes – Sign 3 or more partnership agreements or MOUs with organizations (enterprises, startups, or government agencies) to build on Cardano or trial Cardano solutions. By 2026, target at least 1 live pilot project in each of these categories: government/public sector, enterprise, and social impact/non-profit. For example, a government department using Cardano for a pilot, a private company adopting a Cardano-based supply chain or identity solution, and an NGO leveraging Cardano for a community project. These real use cases will be the ultimate proof of value creation.

* **Talent and Capacity:** BD and leadership capacity – Through the capacity-building program, produce 5–10 trained Cardano “business champions” in Oceania (people who can continue evangelizing and onboarding others beyond 2026). KPI: number of graduates from the BD program who take on leadership roles (e.g. start a Cardano startup, join Cardano Foundation, or lead a local Cardano chapter). Also, have all key team members certified (Cardano Foundation Academy or equivalent) to ensure deep expertise.

* **Content & Outreach Metrics:** Marketing impact – Deliver at least 48 pieces of original content (blog posts, videos, podcasts) over 2 years via community and official channels. Achieve a cumulative reach of \>500,000 impressions on social media and online campaigns promoting Cardano in Oceania . Grow engagement: for instance, raise the average Oceania town hall attendance to \>50 live viewers (from perhaps 20–30 initially) and achieve \>5,000 views on each major video story produced. Media mentions: Secure coverage in at least 5 mainstream or industry media outlets about Cardano activities in Oceania (e.g. an article in an Aussie tech magazine or a segment on NZ tech news).

* **Governance Participation:** Cardano community governance – Increase the involvement of Oceania’s community in Cardano governance processes. KPI: by 2026, have Oceania representation in Catalyst and governance roles such as 2–3 new funded Catalyst proposals coming from Oceania teams, an increase in registered voters from Oceania (target \+30%), and at least one Oceania community member attaining a recognized role (e.g. Catalyst Community Advisor, DRep (delegated representative) or even a Cardano Improvement Proposal co-author).

* **Treasury Return on Investment:** Long-term value creation – While harder to quantify in the short term, we will track indicators of sustainable ecosystem growth that justify the treasury investment. For example, number of new Cardano startups formed (target 3+ by 2026), follow-on funding attracted by Oceania projects (e.g. a project getting external VC or government grants after initial incubation, target: at least $1M in aggregate follow-on funding), and improvements in Cardano’s global metrics attributable to Oceania (such as network effect – more developers and users – contributing to Cardano’s adoption which can reflect in ADA utility/demand). We will present these outcomes in narrative form to illustrate how this program creates value well beyond its cost, seeding economic activity and social good that far exceeds the initial funding.
