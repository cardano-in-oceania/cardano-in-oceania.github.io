# How are we going to implement and verify?

## Budget Overview 2025–2026
The following table summarizes the proposed budget for the Cardano in Oceania initiative, broken down by key components.

| Budget Item | 2025–26 Total (ada) | Notes |
| :---- | ----: | :---- |
| Business Development Program | 120,000 | Contract an Oceania BD team, run BD bootcamps, partner outreach travel. |
| Australian Crypto Convention | 120,000 | Sponsorship package, booth branding and furnishing, promotional material. Cardano side event. |
| Ecosystem Mapping & Activation | 50,000 | Tools, coordinator stipend, surveys for community mapping. |
| Hackathon | 120,000 | Major Oceania Hackathon – venue, logistics, prizes, marketing, mentorship support, some travel grants for participants (based on Berlin hackathon \~₳100k benchmark) |
| Community Events & Workshops | 75,000 | \~20 local in-person events across the region, plus governance/education workshops. |
| Monthly Town Halls (Virtual) | 5,000 | 24 online sessions over 2 years (covering any platform fees, host stipends). |
| Marketing & Communications | 60,000 | Community content fund, paid ads, media sponsorships, video production, and PR agency support. |
| Contingency | 15,000 | Reserve for unplanned costs. |
| Administration & Audits | 18,000 | Fund management and reporting. |
| **Grand Total (2025–2026)** | **583,000** |

This budget reflects a significant investment designed to achieve a step-change in Cardano’s presence in Oceania. We expect to leverage this funding efficiently by also seeking in-kind support and partnerships – for instance, event co-sponsorships could reduce our net costs, and content created by the community often exceeds the value of the modest grants provided.

The spending will be phased over the 12 months, with some front-loading in 2025 (for initial program setup and the hackathon) and the remainder in 2026 (for follow-up events and second-year activities). We will implement strong financial oversight and transparency in managing this budget, with quarterly reports to the Cardano Community broadly, as well as to the Treasury (and any local funders), on expenditures versus the plan. Notably, the hackathon and other initiatives will practice transparent budget management, similar to Catalyst projects. Any unused contingency or cost savings will be reported and potentially returned to the treasury or reallocated with approval.
